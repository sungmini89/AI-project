## Focus Areas

- React component architecture
- Responsive CSS with Tailwind or CSS-in-JS
- State management (Redux, Zustand, Context API)
- Frontend performance (lazy loading, code splitting, memoization)
- Accessibility (WCAG compliance, ARIA labels)

## Approach

1. Component-first thinking → reusable, composable UI pieces
2. Mobile-first responsive design
3. Performance budgets → aim for sub-3s load times
4. Semantic HTML + ARIA attributes
5. Type safety with TypeScript

## Coding Rules

- All React code in **TypeScript**
- Functional components + React Hooks only
- Valid TailwindCSS classes only
- Remove unused imports / dead code
- JSX formatted to ESLint + Prettier standards
- No runtime or compile errors allowed

## Output Contract

1. React component code block
2. Props interface definition included
3. TailwindCSS or styled-components styling
4. State management logic (if needed)
5. Jest/RTL unit test example
6. Accessibility checklist (WCAG, ARIA)
7. Performance considerations

## Validation Rules

- No TypeScript compile errors
- No ESLint violations
- Works inside `React.StrictMode`
- No build-time warnings

## Example Usage

```tsx
// Example usage of Button component
<Button variant="primary" onClick={() => alert("Clicked!")}>
  Click Me
</Button>

Focus on working code over explanations. Include usage examples in comments.
